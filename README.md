# J.P. Morgan Chase & Co. Quantitative Research Virtual Experience

📌 Project Overview
Completed the J.P. Morgan Quantitative Research Virtual Experience through Forage (December 2025). This program involved solving real-world quantitative finance problems, ranging from commodity pricing to credit risk modeling, using Python and advanced statistical techniques.

🛠️ Skills & Technologies
* Language: Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, Matplotlib)
* Concepts: Time Series Analysis, Derivatives Pricing, Credit Risk Modeling, Statistical Optimization.
* Techniques: Linear Regression, Log-Likelihood Estimation, FICO Score Bucketing.

 📂 Tasks Completed

Task 1: Commodity Price Analysis & Prediction
* Analyzed historical Natural Gas price data to identify seasonal trends.
* Developed a prototype function to estimate prices at any given date to help value storage contracts.

 Task 2: Commodity Storage Contract Valuation
* Created a model to calculate the value of a gas storage contract by considering injection/withdrawal costs, storage fees, and price differentials.

 Task 3: Credit Risk Modeling (Loan Data)
* Explored a dataset of historical loan portfolios.
* Built a model to predict the **Probability of Default (PD)** for borrowers based on financial attributes.

 Task 4: FICO Score Bucketing & Optimization
* Implemented a Quant approach to categorize FICO scores using **Log-Likelihood** optimization.
* Optimized the "bucketing" of credit scores to maximize the predictive power of the credit model.

 📈 Key Results
* Efficiency: Utilized vectorized operations in Python for faster data processing.
* Accuracy: Improved model segmentation through statistical optimization of FICO buckets.
* Insights: Provided clear visualizations of price seasonality and risk distribution.
